I am Kartik Choudhary - machine learning engineer at Nextdoor, where I work on the content feed of the Nextdoor app. I have extensive experience building and optimizing real-time recommender systems with strict compute and latency constraints. My expertise lies in integrating structured data with text and video understanding to build highly personalized and adaptive recommendation engines that respond to rapidly evolving user preferences.

I completed my M.S. in Computer Science from the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) in 2024, where my research included LLM evaluation methods, off-policy reinforcement learning in an offline setting, and the safety and interpretability of deep learning models. I completed my B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](https://ee.iitd.ac.in/) in 2019.

I love hiking, skiing, reading fantasy novels, and cooking. I also enjoy connecting with fellow professionals and researchers who are interested in the latest advancements in machine learning. Feel free to reach out to discuss ideas, collaborate on projects, or share insights.
