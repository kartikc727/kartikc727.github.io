I completed my M.S. in Computer Science from the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) in
2024, where my research included off-policy reinforcement learning and evaluation algorithms, as well as safety and
interpretability of language models and other transformer-based systems. I completed my B.Tech. in Electrical
Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](https://ee.iitd.ac.in/) in 2019.
